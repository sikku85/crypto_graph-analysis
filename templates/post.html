                        <h2>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
                        <p>Blockchain technology is a system for transactions that can’t be reversed or tampered with; it allows two parties to engage in secure <a href="https://learn.g2.com/digital-ecosystem" rel="noopener" target="_blank">digital</a> transactions without a third party. It is an automated digital ledger that records every transaction that passes through a computer and broadcasts these transactions to an entire network of computers on a peer-to-peer system. If the transaction is identical on all systems, it’s verified as authentic. This adds another level of security because each transaction is verified several times and is extremely hard to tamper with or falsify.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer ­to­ peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of applications in both financial and non­financial world. The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology and revolution in this space has just begun. This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both financial and non­financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world.</p>

                    The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT).

                            Imagine that a company owns a server farm with 10,000 computers used to maintain a database holding all of its client’s account information. This company owns a warehouse building that contains all of these computers under one roof and has full control of each of these computers and all of the information contained within them. This, however, provides a single point of failure. What happens if the electricity at that location goes out? What if its Internet connection is severed? What if it burns to the ground? What if a bad actor erases everything with a single keystroke? In any case, the data is lost or corrupted.
                            </p>

                                What a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data stored therein—if somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be altered and thus would prevent a bad actor from doing so. If one user tampers with Bitcoin’s record of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.

               <p>To understand why governments are circumspect about Bitcoin, it is important to understand the role that fiat currencies play in a country’s economy. Fiat refers to conventional currencies issued by governments.

               is backed by the full faith and credit of a government. This means that governments promise to make the borrower of a currency whole, in case of a default.
